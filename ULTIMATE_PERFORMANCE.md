### **Complex Legal Text Analysis**
```
Input: "The witness said that he saw the defendant at the scene. 
        According to the plaintiff's testimony, the incident occurred 
        around midnight. She told the court that the defendant 
        allegedly made threatening statements."

Results: ⚠️ HEARSAY DETECTED (4 matches, 9μs):
   • "According to" at position 57-68 (confidence: 95%)
   • "She told" at position 136-143 (confidence: 95%)  
   • "he told" at position 137-143 (confidence: 95%)
   • "allegedly" at position 174-182 (confidence: 95%)
```

**Analysis Time: 9 microseconds for 183 characters = 20.3 million characters/second**
